Tasks: During this period I set up a basic .php file and made a .html file with a form to see if I could link them together.  After 50 minutes I could not, so I posted on the discussion page for the class.

Tasks: During this time I started my actual multtalbe.php file.  Originally, I had given up and decided to just type in get requests into the URL but eventually, I got lucky and my .html testing file started to work.  During this segment I was able to get all the variables working under the correct parameters.
